   Hi, My self  Rajani Velchuri, and I'd like to introduce myself. I went back to school to get my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications engineering. In India, I worked as an Associate and assistant professor in an engineering college. After getting married, I moved to the United States and worked for two years as a Quality assurance analyst. To care for twins, I took a long vacation from my profession. Now that they're nine years old, they don't expect much from me, so I'm reconsidering my decision to pursue a job in software development.

   I am passionate about my work. Because I love waht i do, i have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. For example, I challenge myself and learned to ride a bike to go along with my kids at the age of 38. They are my world and i am their best Mom.
